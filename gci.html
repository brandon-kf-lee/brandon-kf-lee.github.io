									<h1>Multi-Material 3D-Printed Ankle Brace</h1>
									<p>This cast-to-brace intermediate utilizes the rapid protoypability and material diversity <br>
									   of fused deposition modeling (FDM 3D-printing) to create an orthotic solution that aims to fill <br>
									   the gap between rigid casts and less suportive braces.</p>

                <p>This project was a part of Chapman University's Grand Challenges Initiative (GCI) program. Lasting my first and second years, it gathered students from the Fowler School of Engineering and Schmid College of Science and Technology together and formed groups to take on a grand challenge facing the world. My team was quite multidisciplinary: we had a Biology major, an Environmental Science and Policy Major, a Computer Science major, and a Computer Engineering major (me). We decided to take on the field of injuries and injury recovery. We identified a drawback in the conventional post-ankle injury recovery method, noting that its lack of customization hindered rehabilitation efficiency and raised the risk of re-injury. Our initiative sought to leverage the diverse and adaptable properties of 3D-printing and 3D-scanning to design a tailored ankle brace, ensuring an ideal fit for each user's foot. This brace incorporated two materials—one rigid for injury support and one flexible for comfort and mobility.</p>
								<p>Besides working as the team leader, delegating tasks to my teammates, my primary specialty in this project was as the 3D modeler and manufacturer. Before this project, I had never worked with 3D-printers or 3D-printing software. Through sheer will and determination (and lots and lots of YouTube videos), I learned how to consistently print complex mesh brace support structures in many different materials (PETG, polycarbonate, HIPS, etc.) and use Fusion 360 to model a unique brace around a 3D-scanned foot.</p>

										My first step in this project was determining which plastic material we would use. I first thought of using polycarbonate (PC) as the rigid material, so I set out to test it. I encountered a few issues, but the worst was moisture absorption. Like most 3D printable filaments, PC has an affinity for absorbing moisture from the air, especially in a humid environment. Microscopic air bubbles form in the filament, its optical clarity degrades, the filament burns while printing, and its structural integrity significantly weakens. Figure 1 shows a microscopic view of a normal print in transparent PC without any defects. Save for some slight streaking due to suboptimal print settings, the print is perfectly translucent. Figure 2 shows another PC print after the filament has been sitting out for a few weeks. The entire print is filled with bubbles and spotted with slightly browned burns, which could cause the entire print to fail.
								</p>

								<p>Fixing this issue required drying the filament to drive out all the moisture. We placed it in a commercial filament drier and ran it at 70°C for over 12 hours. Even though this solution is convenient, it is not ideal since repeated heating and cooling cycles may deteriorate the material over time. A better long-term solution would be to always store the filament with silica desiccant packs or in a hot, dry environment.</p>
